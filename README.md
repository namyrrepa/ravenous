# Codecademy React Project: Ravenous

1) Purpose:

    List results of search in grid style displaying name, address, type of cuisine, average rating, and number of reviews


4) Future Work (Parts of Project):

    II:     Refactoring existing components using standard unidirectional information flow pattern of React application to establish a foundation for integrating the Yelp API and make data management easier.
